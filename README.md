# Cryptography
Cryptography is a method that can be used to make the data or text sent cannot be understood by others easily using some sort of calculation. Cryptography itself stands for `"crypt"` which means `"hidden"` and `"graphy"` which means `"writing"`. In computer science, cryptography is usually used to secure communication. So the only one that could read each other message is just them.

## Background
This repository can be used to learn how cryptography works (it was my main intention). So that we could understand how things work behind our back. It might be hard to learn about cryptography and I hope this repo will help you understand some of it. Some of these codes were used in my college (BINUS University) project. In every single repo, you could find some comment describing how almost every single line works.

## Usage
To use the encryption/decryption, you could just clone this repo and explore it.
